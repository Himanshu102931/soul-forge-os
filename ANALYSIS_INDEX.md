## 💡 QUICK ANSWERS

### "How much work is needed?"
**Quick fixes:** ~30 hours over 3 weeks  
**Everything:** ~50+ hours over 5-6 weeks  
**Just critical:** ~10-15 hours this week

### "Where do I start?"
1. Fix TypeScript errors (5 min) ← RIGHT NOW
2. Read CODE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md (25 min)
3. Start refactoring NightlyReviewModal (6 hrs)

### "Is my app broken?"
No. It works great. These are enhancements.

### "Do I have to do all of this?"
No. Focus on what matters to you:
- Cost control? → Do rate limiting
- Quality? → Do refactoring
- Performance? → Do optimization
- Stability? → Do validation

### "What if I ignore these issues?"
App continues working fine. Code becomes:
- Harder to maintain
- Harder to test
- More error-prone
- Less scalable

But it doesn't break anything immediately.
