## 🎓 KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER

1. **You're the tester** - Your job is to break it (or verify it works)
2. **I'm the debugger** - If you find issues, I fix them
3. **This is normal** - Almost always find small bugs in testing
4. **It's OK if issues exist** - That's what testing is for!
5. **Ask me anything** - If you're confused, just ask

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEP

**Go test!** Open the test plan and start with Section 1.

When done (or if you hit issues), come back and tell me:

**Example report:**
```
Section 1 (Grid): ✅ All passed
Section 2 (Honeycomb): ✅ All passed
Section 3 (Data): ✅ All passed
Section 4 (Performance): ⚠️ Minor lag during fast zoom
Section 5 (Edge Cases): ✅ All passed

Issues Found: 1 minor
- Zoom speeds up on fast scroll (physics issue)

Ready to Ship: YES! (with one small tweak)
```

---

## 💡 PRO TIP

**Test on both:**
- Desktop (full pan/zoom)
- Mobile/tablet (touch controls)

This gives best coverage.
